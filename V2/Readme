# Taxi Info QR Code System

This project is designed for Mytylschool Roosendaal to securely manage and distribute emergency information for students traveling by taxi.  
It generates encrypted QR codes containing essential student data (name, date, emergency contacts, and additional information).  
These QR codes can be printed as bus cards and scanned by authorized staff during emergencies.

## Key Features

- **Offline Operation:** The application works entirely offline. All assets and data are cached for use without an internet connection.
- **Encrypted Data:** Student information is compressed and encrypted before being embedded in the QR code. Only users with the correct encryption key can decrypt and access the data.
- **GDPR Compliance:** Personal data is handled securely. The encryption key is managed locally and not stored on any server.
- **PDF Export:** The system allows for easy printing of bus cards in PDF format.
- **Cross-platform:** Works on desktop and mobile devices.

## How to Host

You can host this application on any web server or static site hosting service (such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, or your own web server).  
Simply upload the contents of the `V2` folder to your web server.  
No server-side code or database is required.

## How to Customize

You can easily customize the following settings by editing the HTML and JavaScript files:

- **Logo:** Change the logo by replacing `logo.png` or updating the `<img src="logo.png">` tag.
- **Titles:** Edit the `<h1>` tag in `generator.html` and `scanner.html` to set your preferred title.
- **Encryption Key:** Update the `encryptionKey` variable in the JavaScript code of both `generator.html` and `scanner.html` to change the encryption key.

## Usage

1. **Open `index.html` in your browser for an overview.**
2. **Use `generator.html` to create and print bus cards.**
3. **Use `scanner.html` to scan and view student information.**
